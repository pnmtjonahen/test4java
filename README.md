Testing for Java developers

Is BDD testing scary?

Why do we stil have seperate test and develop roles within our project?

As a developer I want to test my code, using Test driven development style, so why not use Behavior driven development as wel.

This repository contains a number of branches, each branch contains a different aspect or implementation of a test definition or process.

1 master
